# Unnamed Kitchen Inventory System (UKIS)

Or, "I wanted to get more familiar with SQL", the side-project.

UKIS is a project inspired by the above, and a desire for a simple, modular solution to tracking the inventory of my kitchen. The data model takes heavy inspiration from [Grocy](https://github.com/grocy/grocy). The project is very much in it's early stages and this README will evolve more as it takes shape. As of right now, UKIS is simply a low-level API that enables basic operations on a PostgreSQL database.
